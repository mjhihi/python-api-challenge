## WeatherPy and VacationPy
For the WeatherPy part, visualize the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator by using a Python script. In the VacationPy part, use the Geoapify API and the geoViews Python library to find the first hotel located within 10,000 meters of your coordinates, and create map visualizations.
